## YOLO 8
A [notebook](https://github.com/puntofisso/Notebook-Scripts-Public/blob/main/YOLO8.ipynb) for Colab, which should also work locally both on a CPU (SLOW!) and a GPU.  
It explains, step by step, how to:

- import dependencies
- use a standard YOLO model for object detection on video*
- train, assess, validate, and use a custom model on video

\* by extension, it works on images.
